# Pacific

PACIFIC is a non-scale war game for 2 players. It is played on a board with pieces which represent naval Attack Planes, Aircraft Carriers, and Kamikazes.

> “One is prepared for surprises in [Finlay’s] work, but not, perhaps, for the advent of PACIFIC... Finlay has previously designed a slate and marble chess set with austerely shaped pieces resembling submarine conning towers, but that was a contemporary invigoration of a traditional game... that was to erect irony upon artifice, that was the traditional mode - with certain differences! - of the poet. It was quite another thing to invite someone to win or lose a game with another player... what had this raiding game to do with the raid on the inarticulate (Eliot?) Poetry may be a superior kind of play, but can play be a superior kind of poetry?” [Orvell “Poe and the Poetics of Pacific” in Ian Hamilton Finlay Collaborations. p.17]
